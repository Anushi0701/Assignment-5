FINDING MEMO

Memo to: Donald Trump’s Campaign Manager

From: Anushi Arora

Date: November 18th, 2016

Subject: Donald Trump’s Linguistic Style

This memo focuses on How Donald trump uses words in his speech, 
including a sentiment analysis of his speech and deep interpretations from the analysis of his three speeches. 

For analyzing the content of his speech, I performed the frequency analysis, sentiment analysis and topic modeling on his speech. 
The words like “will”, “country”, “Clinton”, “immigration”, “American” and “illegal” are frequently being used in his speech. 
The sentiment analysis shows that Trump focuses on negative word more than the positive words. There is a correlation between the 
positive and negative words being used in the three speeches. 

Trump linguistic style definitely has helped him in attracting a lot of audience. He does not complete the sentences and try referring 
to each problem with very powerful examples; such as the one he mentioned in his immigration speech – “This includes incredible Americans 
like 21-year-old Sarah Root. The man who killed her arrived at the border, entered federal custody, and then was released into a 
U.S. community under the policies of this White House. He was released again after the crime, and is now at large. “ 
Trump focuses on making people remember about the pain caused by the terrorist activities in the country and blame his opponents for 
those activities. Trump tries to convince people that he can make the country safe again and will always give priority to Americans. 

In all the three speeches, Trump have used various powerful words and tried expressing high negative sentiments in his thoughts. Also, his 
topic in his speeches is not fixed, he talks about various different things altogether. Due to his repetitive use of strong words and his focus on topics such as National Security, Immigration, Jobs etc. have helped him 
in attracting interest of lot of American population.
